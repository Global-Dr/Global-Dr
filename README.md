I take initiative to uncover edge cases,  optimize it, and align it with user needs.
I proactively design both manual and automated test strategies using tools like Playwright and Cypress for web and UI testing and Postman for APIs, ensuring issues are resolved before they ever reach users.
Also, embed QA into Ci/CD pipelines.
I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to challenge assumptions, streamline processes, and advocate for scalable solutions.
My work directly contributes to the stability of platforms used by thousands of users, and I measure success by how smoothly those users experience our product. 

Ownership isn’t a mindset I adopt — it’s the way I operate.
